## Style Guidelines:

- Dark mode background: Very dark, desaturated purple (#0A0A14), echoing clarity and innovation without being overly literal. Approximates the darkness of night and provides excellent contrast for other elements.
- Primary color: Luminous blue (#7DF9FF) is a vibrant color. Its high brightness will pop out on the dark background. Its hue evokes technology.
- Accent color: Purple (#BE7CFF) to create a visually engaging and modern aesthetic. Analogous to blue and significantly different in saturation for strong contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to convey a computerized, techy feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a neutral, modern look. 
- Use modern, minimalist icons to represent various digital marketing concepts and features, ensuring they are consistent with the CRED-inspired design.
- Implement glassmorphism effects for content blocks and cards, using 3D abstract shapes, floating gradients, and parallax scrolling for a visually immersive experience.
- Incorporate micro-interactions (hover, scroll, and click animations), smooth page transitions, and an animated hero section with glowing elements to enhance user engagement.
